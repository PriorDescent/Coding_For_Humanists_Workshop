#Coding For Humanists Workshop Notes
##11.19.2024

###Analog Computing
-manual counting
-underlining/highlighting important words/frequent words
-counting those words
-looking for positive vs negative words related to those words
-context does matter/ very complex
-synthasise the data to awnser the research question
-Can a computer program do this?

###Computational Approach to Humanistic Coding
-There are exsisting platforms that have been created to leverage computation methods to code large quantities of text
-Eg, Voyant Tools and NVivo
-Coding language Python can also be used to write code to perform various computational forms of text analysis
