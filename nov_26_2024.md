###Basic Structure of Python Solution
-Solutions can also include conditonal statements
-2 forms of statements: If statement, if/else(multiple) statement
-Numeric vs textual data types
-Types of data variables: list, word, interger, float, etc.
-Comparison Operators are used to compare data types
-You can cast variables as a specific data type (ex. string, float, etc.) 

###Boolean Operators
-Boolean (true or false) are used as an operation because computers 'think' in binary.
-Used to compair strings because strings are converted into numbers and then binary.
-3 key boolean operators: and, or, and not
-For and, both values its joining must evaluate to "True" for it to return "True".
-For or, only one of the values its joining must evaluate to "True" for it to return "True". (either/or)
-For not, is used to flip the boolean value following it (ex. not False = True)

###If/Else Statement
-Used for more complicated computational functions and processes.
-If conditions are met, action follows. If conditions are not met, else action follows.
-Ex. if 1==1, print [a], else print [b]

###Loops
-Loops instruct the computer to repeat a conditional statement/task
-Ex. going through a text multiple times to find data
-Code uses true/false answers to express the right instructions
